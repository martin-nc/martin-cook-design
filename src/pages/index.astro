      Need a website for academic project, small business or sub-brand? Don't
      want to deal with digital agencies, or you've hit the limit with site
      builders like Wix and SquareSpace? Or perhaps you just want to talk
      through what options might be best for you?
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a web developer of 25 years' experience, who has worked in many aspects
    of website development, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating and running large and small websites</li>
    <li>Web graphic design</li>
    <li>Web writing and editing</li>
    <li>
      Working with stakeholders to plan and implement redesigns, new features
      and new websites
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensuring sites reach legal requirements for privacy and accessibility
    </li>
    <li>User experience (UX) testing and reviews of site usability</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Now I have my own company specialising in small to medium academic projects.
