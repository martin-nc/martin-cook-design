Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is how you can configure your website to appear higher in search engine results. There is a huge amount written and discussed about this, and no shortage of authoritative-sounding advice about what you need to do.

The major search engines like Google and Yahoo used to have a page of advice for “webmasters”. The pages don’t exist any more, but they gave the same advice: **have unique, interesting content in language natural to your users**.

This is one reason why the [strategy questions](/insights/dont-skip-strategy/) are valuable. They will help you work out why your site is unique and useful, and what words and phrases people are looking for (see [Test little and often](/insights/test-little-often/)).

## Case study: Unique, interesting content

In the naughties I worked for the Institute of Historical Research, the national centre for academic history in the UK. Each month I checked some key terms in the major search engines of the time, to make sure our sites were visible.

The search results came back with big players like BBC History and The History Channel, but there was another site I’d never heard of. Eventually I thought, “What is this site that keeps doing so well in search engines?”

It turned out it was a hobby site run by a man who had researched and written a history of mathematics, with extensive biographies of famous mathematicians. The site looked dated and clunky, but there was probably nowhere else on the web with the same content. It was unique and interesting, and that’s all the SEO he needed.

## Case study: Using words people would say

I once made a site for a family historian. We thought about the questions someone who wanted to hire a family historian would ask if they were in front of us. One of the questions was, “How much does it cost?”.

We made that top-level menu item, and so prominent on the site. No other family historian in the region had done that, and very few had put their costs anywhere.

The site did very well in search engine results because we could see people had specifically searched with phrases like “Family historian how much”. Again, it’s crucial to understand what your users want and what phrases they are looking for. Don't assume you can guess what they are looking for and what language is intuitive for them (see [Beware of false consensus](/insights/beware-false-consensus/)).
