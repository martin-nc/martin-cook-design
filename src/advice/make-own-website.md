There are lots of ways to make your own website. You can use services like Wix, SquareSpace and Canva; you can create a site on WordPress.com or buy web hosting and use the tools your web host provides. None of these need technical knowledge, but here are a couple of things to consider.

## Study the pricing

Try to think through what you need, not just now but in a year (see [Think about budget and time](/advice/budget-and-time/)). You will probably need:

- a domain name,
- an SSL certificate (this makes your site more secure, and stops browser warning about an insecure site),
- web stats, even basic stats about page views.

Here are some questions you might want to ask yourself:

- Are the three things above included in the package? If not, how much does the company charge?
- If you needed to upgrade in a year's time because you wanted more features, how much would that cost? How much would a competitor cost for an upgraded package?
- Is there a free trial where you can try out different solutions and see which you prefer? It's worth taking the time now because once the site is running you probably won't want the palaver of moving it.
- What do the online reviews say?
- If you want to collect personal data like email addresses on the site, is the company GDPR-compliant? Where is the data held and who do they share it with? Remember, you need to put a privacy statement on your site mentioning this.
- How many people will need to log in and change the site? Sometimes basic plans are limited by number of user accounts. You can try sharing one account, but you might find that when one person logs in the other gets logged out!
- How many pages are you allowed? Some starter packages may only give you five pages, for example.

## Tips on making the site

The best general advice is: keep it simple. Don't get carried away with lots of animations and disingenuous marketing text. Most people don't care about that. Just have a clear structure and text that tells people what they need to know.

It also helps to have an idea of who your site is for, and what they want to find or do (see [Don't skip the strategy](/advice/dont-skip-strategy/)).

### Graphic design

Start by establishing your visual branding. This has four elements:

1.  **Logo:** this could be the name of your project or company in a fancy font.
2.  **Colour palette:** your brand colours. Restrict yourself to just one or two main colours. It can be effective when there is a temperature contrast between them, like a cool blue with a warm orange. If you choose blue with a cool green then the whole site could feel cold.
3.  **Fonts:** again, restrict this to one or two. Sometimes it's helpful to have a different font for headings and main text. Make sure they are obviously different, though, and not just a little bit different. You could have a serif font for headings, and sans-serif for main text, for example. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) lists popular fonts you can use, and suggest combinations. If in doubt, just use one font.
4.  **Imagery:** keep images a consistent style. For example, make sure illustrations are done in the same style and with the same colours, from your brand colour palette. Make sure photographs are also consistent, so don't have black and white photos on one page, retro analogue photos on another, and then clean digital colour photos on another.

Most of the "do-it-yourself" services offer design template that you can tweak. Before choosing a template, try drawing on a piece of paper what you would like your site to look like. You can have a piece of paper for each page of the site and think, "What needs to be on this page?"

We mentioned wireframes on the [Test little and often page](/advice/test-little-often/#wireframes). This is where you just draw boxes to represent blocks of text and photographs, so you can quickly sketch what a site might look like.

Now you can choose a template that is a close fit to what you want. Remember you can change the colours of the template to match your colour palette, so don't be put off if the template is in the wrong colours.

### Text

Remember that people who go on the web start off with a task in mind. Imagine you went on a long train journey and forgot your phone. You realise before you get on the train, and buy a magazine to read. On the journey you realise that actually the magazine is quite boring. There aren't any articles that interest you, but you've got nothing else so you read it: you paid for it, and there's nothing else to do.

Now imagine you find your phone. It was in your bag after all. You tap the web, and hop from site to site. Notice the difference in behaviour. With the magazine, the cost of not reading it (i.e. boredom) was more than you wanted to bear, so you pushed yourself to read, even though it wasn't what you hoped for.

With the web, the cost of leaving a site is zero. If you don't see what you want in two or three seconds, you can click to another. Bear this in mind when creating a site. Get on with telling people what they came to find out, and use their own words to do it.

### Feedback

In the [Test little and often page](/advice/test-little-often/) we talked about the importance of getting feedback. When you've got your site, ask for feedback. If possible, be next to someone and watch them use the site. Ideally you'd ask people who are you target audience to look at it, but even friends are better than nothing. They will tell you the most obviously confusing things.

### A free website?

If you don't want to spend any money at all on a website, you could use social media like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest and Bluesky. It depends on what you do, and what audience you want to reach.

The next step up would be to create a free website with a service like Weebly, Yola or Wordpress.com. You need to be careful of [lobster pot deals](/advice/budget-and-time/#lobster-pot), though. These are ones that are intended to draw you in and then trap you. They may only include two web pages, for example, and will not include your own domain name. This may not be obvious when you sign up, and quickly you realise you need to upgrade and start paying.

Another approach is to create a website with a system like Jekyll, Gatsby or NextJs and host it on GitHub, Netlify or Vercel. This takes quite some technical knowledge, though, and if you haven't got that you're probably better off choosing another option.
